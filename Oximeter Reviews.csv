"If you want to panic, or IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIBED, buy one of these !",1.0,"The first reading this morning showed I had blood oxygenation of 99% - with a pulse of 40!  Confident that I am NOT Michael Jordan, I tried a multi-device comparison. In this, my blood pressure tester showed a pulse of 76, my cheap pink meter showed a pulse of 74, and the SantaMedical showed my pulse at 56.  The BP tester was on my left arm, the two finger meters on my right hand.  All readings were taken simultaneously.  The BP device, the pink finger meter, and my subjective experience were in accordance with each other.  The SantaMedical was consistently an outlier.  I have no way to evaluate whether the PI readings are accurate or not, but I note they ranged from 1.5 to 5.0 within 10 minutes without any external variables changing.  Beautiful display.  Crazy data.  Going back!Feb 2, 2021  These vendors are incredibly - BAD.  They must have sent me at least eight emails asking me to delete this review of their defective junk.  Several plead that it is a family business and bad reviews hurt, implying that I am against family and hurting children because I've taken the time to write an honest review.In at least three of their emails to me, they have offered to bribe me.  The first bribe offer was for $30.  In the second or third, they upped their bribe offer to $35.  This, on a product that costs less than $20.  The vendors include links to facilitate deleting and or modifying my 1 star review.  (At this point it would be a negative 5 star rating if I could give that instead of a +1 star.)  I told them that if they sent me a meter that gave accurate data, that I'd test it and update this review - but no!  Their response was to tell me that because of Covid-19 they COULDN'T sent me a replacement meter.  Covid-19 doesn't, however, seem to diminish their efforts to sell more meters right here, today!  Shame on them."
Snoopy has a pulse and an oxygen reading!,1.0,How can we trust this device when stuffed animals generate readings? A Sharpie has a pulse of 66 and an oxygen rating of 99? We also had one individual show a pulse rate of 164 and then a minute or so later a pulse rate of 72. Not cool.
Peace of mind,5.0,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients.  I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office.  This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power.  I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses.  I also like that the battery power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time."
Reliable & portable,5.0,"This is an easy to read & reliable Pulse Oximeter. When I researched an unbiased rating on Pulse Oximeters, this SantaMedical brand was listed as highest rated!"
Finally a product that works,5.0,"I had already returned several oximeters before I bought this one.  They either didn't work at all, or were all over the place.  After doing research off of Amazon I discovered this oximeter at the top of most lists.  It works consistently, is easy to read, and very comfortable (and does not look cheesy).  Would recommend to anyone"
Inaccurate,1.0,Least accurate pulse Ox I came across. I am a MD. I use these for a living. The inaccuracy was disappointing of the oxygen reading was a disappointment. Will have to buy a different one from CVS or Walgreen. Amazon should not be carrying this device on its site.
Actual accuracy is important for instant results,2.0,"After receiving this SANTAMEDICAL pulse/oxygen meter. I read the actual specifications that were in the Operation Manual.The accuracy is listed as being  PLUS or MINUS 3% for SpO2, this latitude in accuracy could lead to misleading conclusions.The meter should therfore be used only for reading trends.Daily readings should be recorded and the trend if any noted before coming to conclusions regarding any individual measurement.If you are not sure or are in doubt, have the readings confirmed by having your SpO2 levels and heart rate measured on a medically approved pulse/oxygen meter.I bought this to measure my and my wife's SpO2, if we started to have indications of Covid19  infection."
Works as intended!,5.0,"I bought this just to keep in the house to get an accurate pulse and oxygen reading. There have been a few times in which members of my family have had incidents (ended up being not too serious) but due to the whole Covid situation, were fearful of it being something else. So we used this and then later found it was just acid reflux. Gives me peace of mind having this around."
User Friendly pulse oximeter,5.0,I give your product a rating of 5.  This rating was given because I found it very easy to get it up and running.  It’s easy to use even though I have fibromyalgia.  I expect that the quality of your product the pulse oximeter will last a long time if taken proper care of.Sincerely looking forward to using this for several years.
Critically Important Device,5.0,"Given what is happening in the world today, self-monitoring of health is critically important. The pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen, so it could be an early indicator that an issue has arisen. The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."

Critically Important Device,5.0,"Given what is happening in the world today, self-monitoring of health is critically important. The pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen, so it could be an early indicator that an issue has arisen. The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."
"If you want to panic, or IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIBED, buy one of these !",1.0,"The first reading this morning showed I had blood oxygenation of 99% - with a pulse of 40!  Confident that I am NOT Michael Jordan, I tried a multi-device comparison. In this, my blood pressure tester showed a pulse of 76, my cheap pink meter showed a pulse of 74, and the SantaMedical showed my pulse at 56.  The BP tester was on my left arm, the two finger meters on my right hand.  All readings were taken simultaneously.  The BP device, the pink finger meter, and my subjective experience were in accordance with each other.  The SantaMedical was consistently an outlier.  I have no way to evaluate whether the PI readings are accurate or not, but I note they ranged from 1.5 to 5.0 within 10 minutes without any external variables changing.  Beautiful display.  Crazy data.  Going back!Feb 2, 2021  These vendors are incredibly - BAD.  They must have sent me at least eight emails asking me to delete this review of their defective junk.  Several plead that it is a family business and bad reviews hurt, implying that I am against family and hurting children because I've taken the time to write an honest review.In at least three of their emails to me, they have offered to bribe me.  The first bribe offer was for $30.  In the second or third, they upped their bribe offer to $35.  This, on a product that costs less than $20.  The vendors include links to facilitate deleting and or modifying my 1 star review.  (At this point it would be a negative 5 star rating if I could give that instead of a +1 star.)  I told them that if they sent me a meter that gave accurate data, that I'd test it and update this review - but no!  Their response was to tell me that because of Covid-19 they COULDN'T sent me a replacement meter.  Covid-19 doesn't, however, seem to diminish their efforts to sell more meters right here, today!  Shame on them."
Snoopy has a pulse and an oxygen reading!,1.0,How can we trust this device when stuffed animals generate readings? A Sharpie has a pulse of 66 and an oxygen rating of 99? We also had one individual show a pulse rate of 164 and then a minute or so later a pulse rate of 72. Not cool.
Peace of mind,5.0,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients.  I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office.  This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power.  I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses.  I also like that the battery power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time."
Reliable & portable,5.0,"This is an easy to read & reliable Pulse Oximeter. When I researched an unbiased rating on Pulse Oximeters, this SantaMedical brand was listed as highest rated!"
Finally a product that works,5.0,"I had already returned several oximeters before I bought this one.  They either didn't work at all, or were all over the place.  After doing research off of Amazon I discovered this oximeter at the top of most lists.  It works consistently, is easy to read, and very comfortable (and does not look cheesy).  Would recommend to anyone"
Inaccurate,1.0,Least accurate pulse Ox I came across. I am a MD. I use these for a living. The inaccuracy was disappointing of the oxygen reading was a disappointment. Will have to buy a different one from CVS or Walgreen. Amazon should not be carrying this device on its site.
Actual accuracy is important for instant results,2.0,"After receiving this SANTAMEDICAL pulse/oxygen meter. I read the actual specifications that were in the Operation Manual.The accuracy is listed as being  PLUS or MINUS 3% for SpO2, this latitude in accuracy could lead to misleading conclusions.The meter should therfore be used only for reading trends.Daily readings should be recorded and the trend if any noted before coming to conclusions regarding any individual measurement.If you are not sure or are in doubt, have the readings confirmed by having your SpO2 levels and heart rate measured on a medically approved pulse/oxygen meter.I bought this to measure my and my wife's SpO2, if we started to have indications of Covid19  infection."
Works as intended!,5.0,"I bought this just to keep in the house to get an accurate pulse and oxygen reading. There have been a few times in which members of my family have had incidents (ended up being not too serious) but due to the whole Covid situation, were fearful of it being something else. So we used this and then later found it was just acid reflux. Gives me peace of mind having this around."

Works as intended!,5.0,"I bought this just to keep in the house to get an accurate pulse and oxygen reading. There have been a few times in which members of my family have had incidents (ended up being not too serious) but due to the whole Covid situation, were fearful of it being something else. So we used this and then later found it was just acid reflux. Gives me peace of mind having this around."
User Friendly pulse oximeter,5.0,I give your product a rating of 5.  This rating was given because I found it very easy to get it up and running.  It’s easy to use even though I have fibromyalgia.  I expect that the quality of your product the pulse oximeter will last a long time if taken proper care of.Sincerely looking forward to using this for several years.
Critically Important Device,5.0,"Given what is happening in the world today, self-monitoring of health is critically important. The pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen, so it could be an early indicator that an issue has arisen. The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."
"If you want to panic, or IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIBED, buy one of these !",1.0,"The first reading this morning showed I had blood oxygenation of 99% - with a pulse of 40!  Confident that I am NOT Michael Jordan, I tried a multi-device comparison. In this, my blood pressure tester showed a pulse of 76, my cheap pink meter showed a pulse of 74, and the SantaMedical showed my pulse at 56.  The BP tester was on my left arm, the two finger meters on my right hand.  All readings were taken simultaneously.  The BP device, the pink finger meter, and my subjective experience were in accordance with each other.  The SantaMedical was consistently an outlier.  I have no way to evaluate whether the PI readings are accurate or not, but I note they ranged from 1.5 to 5.0 within 10 minutes without any external variables changing.  Beautiful display.  Crazy data.  Going back!Feb 2, 2021  These vendors are incredibly - BAD.  They must have sent me at least eight emails asking me to delete this review of their defective junk.  Several plead that it is a family business and bad reviews hurt, implying that I am against family and hurting children because I've taken the time to write an honest review.In at least three of their emails to me, they have offered to bribe me.  The first bribe offer was for $30.  In the second or third, they upped their bribe offer to $35.  This, on a product that costs less than $20.  The vendors include links to facilitate deleting and or modifying my 1 star review.  (At this point it would be a negative 5 star rating if I could give that instead of a +1 star.)  I told them that if they sent me a meter that gave accurate data, that I'd test it and update this review - but no!  Their response was to tell me that because of Covid-19 they COULDN'T sent me a replacement meter.  Covid-19 doesn't, however, seem to diminish their efforts to sell more meters right here, today!  Shame on them."
Snoopy has a pulse and an oxygen reading!,1.0,How can we trust this device when stuffed animals generate readings? A Sharpie has a pulse of 66 and an oxygen rating of 99? We also had one individual show a pulse rate of 164 and then a minute or so later a pulse rate of 72. Not cool.
Peace of mind,5.0,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients.  I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office.  This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power.  I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses.  I also like that the battery power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time."
Reliable & portable,5.0,"This is an easy to read & reliable Pulse Oximeter. When I researched an unbiased rating on Pulse Oximeters, this SantaMedical brand was listed as highest rated!"
Finally a product that works,5.0,"I had already returned several oximeters before I bought this one.  They either didn't work at all, or were all over the place.  After doing research off of Amazon I discovered this oximeter at the top of most lists.  It works consistently, is easy to read, and very comfortable (and does not look cheesy).  Would recommend to anyone"
Inaccurate,1.0,Least accurate pulse Ox I came across. I am a MD. I use these for a living. The inaccuracy was disappointing of the oxygen reading was a disappointment. Will have to buy a different one from CVS or Walgreen. Amazon should not be carrying this device on its site.

After doing research off of Amazon I discovered this oximeter at the top of most lists.  It works consistently, is easy to read, and very comfortable (and does not look cheesy).  Would recommend to anyone"
Inaccurate,1.0,Least accurate pulse Ox I came across. I am a MD. I use these for a living. The inaccuracy was disappointing of the oxygen reading was a disappointment. Will have to buy a different one from CVS or Walgreen. Amazon should not be carrying this device on its site.
Actual accuracy is important for instant results,2.0,"After receiving this SANTAMEDICAL pulse/oxygen meter. I read the actual specifications that were in the Operation Manual.The accuracy is listed as being  PLUS or MINUS 3% for SpO2, this latitude in accuracy could lead to misleading conclusions.The meter should therfore be used only for reading trends.Daily readings should be recorded and the trend if any noted before coming to conclusions regarding any individual measurement.If you are not sure or are in doubt, have the readings confirmed by having your SpO2 levels and heart rate measured on a medically approved pulse/oxygen meter.I bought this to measure my and my wife's SpO2, if we started to have indications of Covid19  infection."
Works as intended!,5.0,"I bought this just to keep in the house to get an accurate pulse and oxygen reading. There have been a few times in which members of my family have had incidents (ended up being not too serious) but due to the whole Covid situation, were fearful of it being something else. So we used this and then later found it was just acid reflux. Gives me peace of mind having this around."
User Friendly pulse oximeter,5.0,I give your product a rating of 5.  This rating was given because I found it very easy to get it up and running.  It’s easy to use even though I have fibromyalgia.  I expect that the quality of your product the pulse oximeter will last a long time if taken proper care of.Sincerely looking forward to using this for several years.
Critically Important Device,5.0,"Given what is happening in the world today, self-monitoring of health is critically important. The pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen, so it could be an early indicator that an issue has arisen. The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."
"If you want to panic, or IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIBED, buy one of these !",1.0,"The first reading this morning showed I had blood oxygenation of 99% - with a pulse of 40!  Confident that I am NOT Michael Jordan, I tried a multi-device comparison. In this, my blood pressure tester showed a pulse of 76, my cheap pink meter showed a pulse of 74, and the SantaMedical showed my pulse at 56.  The BP tester was on my left arm, the two finger meters on my right hand.  All readings were taken simultaneously.  The BP device, the pink finger meter, and my subjective experience were in accordance with each other.  The SantaMedical was consistently an outlier.  I have no way to evaluate whether the PI readings are accurate or not, but I note they ranged from 1.5 to 5.0 within 10 minutes without any external variables changing.  Beautiful display.  Crazy data.  Going back!Feb 2, 2021  These vendors are incredibly - BAD.  They must have sent me at least eight emails asking me to delete this review of their defective junk.  Several plead that it is a family business and bad reviews hurt, implying that I am against family and hurting children because I've taken the time to write an honest review.In at least three of their emails to me, they have offered to bribe me.  The first bribe offer was for $30.  In the second or third, they upped their bribe offer to $35.  This, on a product that costs less than $20.  The vendors include links to facilitate deleting and or modifying my 1 star review.  (At this point it would be a negative 5 star rating if I could give that instead of a +1 star.)  I told them that if they sent me a meter that gave accurate data, that I'd test it and update this review - but no!  Their response was to tell me that because of Covid-19 they COULDN'T sent me a replacement meter.  Covid-19 doesn't, however, seem to diminish their efforts to sell more meters right here, today!  Shame on them."
Snoopy has a pulse and an oxygen reading!,1.0,How can we trust this device when stuffed animals generate readings? A Sharpie has a pulse of 66 and an oxygen rating of 99? We also had one individual show a pulse rate of 164 and then a minute or so later a pulse rate of 72. Not cool.
Peace of mind,5.0,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients.  I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office.  This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power.  I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses.  I also like that the battery power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time."
